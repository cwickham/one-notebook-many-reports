## Abstract

Would you rather read a “Climate summary” or a “Climate summary for _exactly where you live_”? Producing documents that tailor your scientific results to an individual or their situation increases understanding, engagement, and connection. But, producing many reports can be onerous. 

If you are looking for a way to automate producing many reports, or you produce reports like this but find yourself in copy-and-paste hell, come along to learn how Quarto solves this problem with parameterized reports - you create a single Python notebook, but you generate many beautiful customized PDFs.

## Description

This talk describes Quarto parameterized reports, a powerful tool for automating the creation of customized, publication-ready documents from Python notebooks. Data professionals can streamline their workflows and enhance scientific communication by generating multiple personalized reports from a single source, such as risk summaries for different zip codes or individualized soil health reports for farmers. 

The talk will walk through a practical example of taking a notebook that produces a single report, to a workflow that generates many customized reports. Attendees will learn how to:

* Add parameters to a notebook so Quarto recognizes them
* Use parameters in their code cells (spoiler: just use them like any other variable)
* Render to an output format with specific parameter values
* Automate rendering many reports over a set of parameter values

I’ll also touch on how to customize style to match organizational branding guidelines. 

This talk is for data professionals that need to communicate their results to multiple stakeholders. It will give them a tool to take the code they already have to produce values, tables, and plots, and turn it into a set of customized reports. I’ll assume no prior Quarto knowledge.
